# Document Refinements Applied - Summary

**Date:** 2nd February 2026  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Overview
All three Word documents have been successfully refined based on feedback to strengthen payment terms, scope protection, and legal clarity.

## Changes by Document

### 1. INVOICE_2_YoNISeRD.docx

**Added:**
- **Deposit/Balance Breakdown:**
  - Deposit Received: KSh 2,000
  - Balance Due: KSh 14,500
  
- **Payment Clarity Note:**
  - "Partial payments do not constitute full settlement. Full payment is required."

**Purpose:** Makes the payment status crystal clear and prevents disputes over partial payment scenarios.

### 2. PROJECT_QUOTATION_V2_YoNISeRD.docx

**Added:**
- **Change Requests Clause** (new section):
  - "Any changes beyond this defined scope will be billed separately at agreed rates."
  
- **Timeline Precision** (updated with actual dates):
  - Launch & Deployment – 2nd February 2026 (Completed)
  - Post-Launch Support – 30 days from 2nd February 2026

**Purpose:** Prevents scope creep by explicitly stating additional changes are billable; actual dates demonstrate project completion.

### 3. WEBSITE_DEVELOPMENT_AGREEMENT_V2_YoNISeRD.docx

**Added:**
- **Source Code Handover Condition** (new section):
  - "Complete source code and project files will be provided only after full payment (KSh 16,500) is received."

- **Deposit Non-Refund Policy** (in Termination section):
  - "Deposit Policy: The initial deposit of KSh 2,000 is non-refundable."

**Purpose:** Protects you from premature code release and ensures deposit commitment ensures you're compensated for work even if the client cancels.
